term A may be
    constant X has X : A |
    variable Name has Name : string |
    function S Terms has S : string, Terms : list (term A) .

rule A may be
    rl LHS => RHS has LHS : term A, RHS : term A .

match Term with Pat is
    when Pat = variable Y then singleton list Y |-> Term;
    when Term = constant X, Pat = constant X then empty;
    when Term = function S Terms, Pat = function S Pats then
        flatten zip same length (match _ with _) Terms and Pats.

substitute in Term using Theta is
    when Term = function S Terms then function S (map (substitute in _ using Theta) over Terms);
    when Term = variable Var then
        when Theta contains (Var |-> NewTerm) then NewTerm;
        default Term;
    default Term = constant X, Term.

subterm of Term at position P is
    when P = Idx :: Idxs,
         Term = function S Terms,
         Idx < length of Terms then
         subterm of (Idx th element of Terms) at position Idxs;
    default P = empty, Term.

replace subterm of Term at position P with NewTerm is
    when P = Idx :: Idxs,
         Term = function S Terms then
            NewArg = replace subterm of (Idx th element of Terms) at position Idxs with NewTerm,
            function S (set index Idx of Terms to NewArg);
    default P = empty, NewTerm.

apply rule (rl LHS => RHS) to Term is
    U = subterm of Term at position P,
    match U with LHS = Theta,
    replace subterm of Term at position P with substitute in RHS using Theta.

func Name Arg is function Name (singleton list Arg).
bifunc Name A B is function Name (cons A (cons B empty)).

concat strings Strs is
    when Strs = empty then "";
    when Strs = cons H T, T != empty then H .. "," .. concat strings T;
    when Strs = cons H T, T = empty then H .. concat strings T.

format term Term is
    when Term = constant X then as text X;
    when Term = variable V then V;
    when Term = function S Terms then
        FormattedTerms = map (format term _) over Terms,
        S .. "(" .. (concat strings FormattedTerms) .. ")" .

evaluate Term using Rules is
    display ("Evaluating: " .. (format term Term)),
    when Rules contains Rule, apply rule Rule to Term = NewTerm then
        evaluate NewTerm using Rules;
    default Term.

nat rules are
    cons (rl (bifunc "+" (constant 0) (variable "M")) => (variable "M")) (
    cons (rl (bifunc "+" (func "s" (variable "N")) (variable "M")) => (func "s" (bifunc "+" (variable "N") (variable "M")))) (
    cons (rl (bifunc "*" (constant 0) (variable "M")) => (constant 0)) (
    cons (rl (bifunc "*" (func "s" (variable "N")) (variable "M")) => (bifunc "+" (variable "M") (bifunc "*" (variable "N") (variable "M")))) empty))).

as succ nat N is
    when N = 0 then constant 0;
    when N > 0 then func "s" (as succ nat (N - 1)).

A = as succ nat 5,
B = as succ nat 6,
display format term evaluate (bifunc "*" A B) using nat rules.
