use parsing.
do not use base.

assert A and B equal if
    when A = B then
        display ("PASSED: " .. as text A .. " = " .. as text B);
    when A != B then
        display ("FAILED: " .. as text A .. " != " .. as text B).

assert (format rule parse rule "+(0,M)=>M") and "rl +(0,M) => M" equal.
assert (format rule parse rule "+(s(N),M)=>M") and "rl +(s(N),M) => M" equal.
assert (format rule parse rule "*(0,M)=>0") and "rl *(0,M) => 0" equal.
assert (format rule parse rule "*(s(N),M)=>+(M,*(N,M))") and "rl *(s(N),M) => +(M,*(N,M))" equal.
